# Disclaimer

1.	This prototype was developed only to serve the purpose of presenting the Service Oriented Rural Platform concept.   
2.	This prototype is deployed to the free version of Mendix Cloud, a low-code development platform.
3.	Hence, there is a limitation imposing the server to enter sleep mode after 1 hour of inactivity, which will need Â± 1 minute for the server to restart so that it can be accessed/used. Because of this, it is recommended to (re-)start/access all application mentioned above to make sure all of them are running, which is important to ensure smooth data exchange.
